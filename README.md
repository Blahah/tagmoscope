# tagma

> Tagma - The organisational tool we've always wanted, but haven't been able to find (noun) [_Ancient Greek τάγμα, tágma:  “something which has been ordered or arranged”_].

This is a work in progress.

Current functionality:

- add/edit tasks
- Github-flavored markdown in task contents, with code syntax highlighting
- instant as-you-type task search
- tasks have 'guilt' associated with them, you can increment it and sort the tasks by it
- simple list-view of tasks, with expandable task cards
