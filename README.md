# tagma

> Tagma - The organisational tool we've always wanted, but haven't been able to find (noun) [_Ancient Greek τάγμα, tágma:  “something which has been ordered or arranged”_].


**NOTE** this is design by README - we haven't actually built anything yet

Features it should eventually have:

- projects and tasks
  - can be assigned guilt - there's a button or something to increment the guilt for an item. Intuition: "how often do I feel bad for not having done this?"
  - can be assigned priors or weights - a numerical or categorical field. Intution: "how important do I *think* this is?"
  - timing
    - complex frequencies (e.g. at least twice a week, every day, once a month on the 6th, etc.)
    - deadlines
    - durations (i.e. estimated time the work will take)
- views
  - high level view across all projects - perhaps as a mind map
  - tasks
    - all task views allow creation of new tasks/projects
    - kanban board (overall or per project)
    - list (overall or per projects)
    - can be filtered or ranked by 'stagnation' or conversely` 'activity'
    - can be filtered or ranked by 'guilt'
    - can display items from one or many projects
    - calendar view, showing work done in the past, and impending deadlines and end dates
  - data dashboard
    - tasks completed over time (overall and per project)
    - projects by activity (some visual marker of the relative activity on projects)
    - some way of visualising how thinking changes over time (NLP analysis of task descriptions?)
    - times completed vs missed for deadlines, durations and repetitions, total or over time
- data storage
  - sync with github issues, but can also work independently
  - export to some standard todo-list format?
- app
  - webapp (node? ... meteor?)
  - desktop app (webapp packaged with e.g. electron)
  - mobile apps (webapp packaged with e.g. cordova?)
